It's come down to a little over a year left and I'm realizing that even if do as much as possible (within the limitations of my current career) I won't have the degree completed by the time I finish my enlistment. I'd like to move into a career in development, it's sort of always been my dream, and it what I enjoy. I've excelled in the classes having to do with programming, and I have a pretty decent understanding of C++ and C#.\n\nMy question is, should I move my efforts towards acquiring a certification or two before my enlistment's finished, then finish the BS when I get inside the career field I want? Would certifications offer me a decent chance to crack into the field? Or should I look for temporary work after I get out until I can finish the degree?\n\nEdit: or a possible 3rd option.
